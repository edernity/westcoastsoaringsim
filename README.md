westcoastsoaringsim - jump and run game takes the original look and feel by Peter Spear from West Coast Soaring Club, Vancouver and provides pluggable dynamics for weather, aircraft and autopilot via FMI interfaces from SIANI, Gran Canaria. This game is implemented in JavaFX, to be runnable on home computers and mobile devices.

This work is based on a paraglider simulation and visualization game by Peter Spear,

as announced here: http://www.paraglidingforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=43670 in 2011.                                                                                                                                                           
The goal is to port his game to JavaFX and use JavaFMI from SIANI/Spain to modularize                                                                                                                                                       
pilot, glider and weather models showcasing FMI/FMU interoperability in a fun way.                                                                                                                                                          
It allows the user to design and exchange custom models and compare against others and even manual flight.
