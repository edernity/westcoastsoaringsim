 * This work is based on a paraglider simulation and visualization game by Peter Spear,
 * Director of the Westcoast Soaring Club in Canada, originally written in ProcessingJS 
 * (see http://www3.telus.net/cschwab/simPG/simGlider.pde), 
 * as announced here: http://www.paraglidingforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=43670 in 2011.
 * The goal is to port his game to JavaFX and use JavaFMI from SIANI/Spain to modularize 
 * pilot, glider and weather models showcasing FMI/FMU interoperability in a fun way.
 * It allows the user to design and exchange custom models and compare against others and even manual flight.
