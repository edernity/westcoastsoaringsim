// The physics of this simulation is as accurate as possible.
// Polar Data came from XFLR5 Foil analysis program.
//		http://xflr5.sourceforge.net/xflr5.htm
// The foil and glider design came from the GNULAB2 work of
// 	Pere H. Casellas Laboratori d'envol
//		http://www.laboratoridenvol.com/projects/gnuLAB2/gnuLAB2.en.html
// Big thanks to the Processing.js guys! What a great visualization tool!
//		http://processingjs.org/
// Beats hell out of my original C program that just spewed numbers.
//
// Feel free to modify and tweek this design as much as you like.
// Note that it took quite a bit to get the glider to stall and recover
// in a realistic manner. It is quite sensitive to values of the lift and
// drag coeficients. It is easy to break it. The XFLR5 polar data is only
// used between -16 degrees and +25 degrees aoa. Outside this range values
// for lift and drag were guessed at and tweeked.
//
// Further note to tweekers. Paragliders are almost pitch un-stable. Reduce the
// glider drag just little and the glider will become unstable. Play with it
// for a bit and you will soon give up on the "pendulum stability" idea.
//
// Have fun. Tune up your active flying, work on your infinite tumble and try a loop-de-loop
